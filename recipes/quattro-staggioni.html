        </ul>

        <h4>For the toppings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoon passata/pureed tomatoes</li>
            <li>8.8 oz (250g) mozzarella</li>
            <li>5.6 oz (160g) mushrooms ,finely sliced</li>
            <li>6.3 oz (180g) artichoke hearts, jarred and cut in half</li>
            <li>2.4 (70g) pitted black olives, cut in half</li>
            <li>4 large slices Italian ham</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the yeast to the lukewarm water with ½ teaspoon sugar for 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.
                 Make a well in the centre and add the water/yeast mixture whilst mixing the dough together with a spoon until you have obtained a dough.
                 If it's too sticky you can gradually add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and knead the dough for around 5-10 minutes until it's silky smooth and soft.
                 If you lightly press your finger on the ball of dough it should spring back up easily.
                  Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a large clean bowl and rub all over until the bowl is coated.
                   Shape the dough into a ball and place in the bowl, rub the top of the dough with a tiny amount of olive oil.
                 Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place for at least 3 hours until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to make the pizzas place your pizza trays in the oven and preheat the oven to 220°C/425F/gas mark 7.</li>
            <li>Divide your dough in half roughly with your hands and place on a lightly floured work surface.
                 Press lightly in the dough to shape it into a rough circle or rectangle then using a rolling pin dusted with flour roll the dough out to fit your tray.
                 The dough should be rolled out as thin as possible without tearing.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza tray from the oven and dust lightly with semolina flour.
                 Transfer your dough to the tray and spread with 3 tablespoon of passata, you don’t want to much or your pizza will go soggy.
                 Tear up half the mozzarella with your hands and dot it over the base.</li>
            <li>Finally, add your toppings over four sections of the pizza.
                Repeat with the second pizza and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the cheese has melted and the crust is crispy.</li>
        </ol>
